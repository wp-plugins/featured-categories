Creates a widget that displays posts and thumbnails in a selected category.

== Description ==

Creates a widget that displays posts and thumbnails in a selected category. Thumbnails will display 100px square. Author name links to author page (if in use) or list of posts. Posts are sorted in descending order by date. This is a fork of [James Lao's Category Posts plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/category-posts/), with less options.

Style "thumbcol" and "contentcol" classes to make it look pretty (make the thumb appear to the left of the excerpt, for example).
